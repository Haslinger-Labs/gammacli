# Gamma ion pump ethernet control CLI utility and library

This is a mini Python 3 library and utility that exposes some of the functions
of the Gamma Vacuum QPC ion pump controller via a CLI or via a library class
via it's Ethernet port.

__Note__: This utility is in no way associated with Gamma Vacuum and is
_not_ an official product. It's just a simple tool that emerged out of my
requirements to interact with their pump controllers. There is no guarantee that
this utility will work under any circumstances, won't damage your controller
or will work after firmware upgrades, etc.
